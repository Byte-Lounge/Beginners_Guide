| **White Hat Hacker**  | A white hat hacker is can also defined as an ethical hacker. This type of hacker would normally be paid by an employer and have authorized access to a system to search for vulnerabilities. This can be also known as a  penetration Testing. | 
| **Grey Hat Hacker**   | All areas in life have a grey area as well, this is also right for hacking as well. A grey hat hacker could be someone that access a system to find vulnerabilities to report to the owner of the system for some compensation. If the owner refused to pay, then the hacker could upload the vulnerability online for a zero-day exploit. The grey hat hacker intention was to do good but resulted in malicious outcome.  |
| **Black Hat Hacker**  | A black hat hacker falls on the other end of the scale to a white hat hacker. This hacker relies on knowledge to break into systems and computers to gain a personal or financial gain.
